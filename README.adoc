= asciidoc-wg.eclipse.org

The https://asciidoc-wg.eclipse.org website is generated with https://gohugo.io/documentation/[Hugo].

The AsciiDoc Working Group drives the standardization, adoption, and evolution of AsciiDoc. This group encourages and shapes the open, collaborative development of the AsciiDoc language and its processors.

== Getting started

=== Prerequisites

The following pre-requisites are necessary to create a local preview of the site.
If you only want to change content without a local preview, only a text editor is necessary to change content.

* Node and NPM (LTS 14.x) to install resources and dependencies - see https://nodejs.org/
* Hugo to render site from templates and content - see https://gohugo.io/
* Asciidoctor to transform AsciiDoc content to HTML - see https://asciidoctor.org/

=== Running a local preview of the site

Install dependencies, build assets and start a webserver:

[source,bash]
----
npm install && hugo server --destination=public
----

You can find guidance on the page-level metadata https://eclipsefdn-hugo-solstice-theme.netlify.app/[here], and examples of the assorted page types (components) https://eclipsefdn-hugo-solstice-theme.netlify.app/components/[here].
