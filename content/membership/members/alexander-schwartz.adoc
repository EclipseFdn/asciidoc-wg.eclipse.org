// description is taken from nomination for steering committee
While being a Java and JavaScript developer, Alexander has been using Asciidoctor for several years in various projects for documentation.
It allows Alexander to write reusable content without distraction.
At conferences Alexander talks about documentation as code and presents deep-dive talks on AsciiDoc.

In 2014, Alexander made his first contribution to the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ.
Over time, he dug deeper in the AsciiDoc syntax, investigating how auto-completion could work and what it needs to support writers in an IDE.
Today Alexander is the current maintainer of the plugin.
One of his latest contributions was adding Antora support in close cooperation with the community.
