The goal of this project is to provide a native and compatible implementation of the AsciiDoc Language specification that can be run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

This will allow languages such as Java, Kotlin, Groovy, Scala, and JRuby, that run on the JVM, to process AsciiDoc-based documentation as part of a build process or application.

// <!--more-->

Today these languages can process AsciiDoc using AsciidoctorJ.
However, AsciidoctorJ relies on JRuby to wrap the Asciidoctor Ruby implementation with a Java API.
We want to take this opportunity to not only create a compatible implementation, but one that is written directly in Java so it has a lighter footprint and improved performance.
