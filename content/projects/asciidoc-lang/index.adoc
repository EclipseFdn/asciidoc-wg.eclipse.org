AsciiDoc is a comprehensive, semantic markup language for producing a variety of presentation-rich output formats from content encoded in a concise, human-readable, plain text format.
It also includes a set of APIs for transforming the encoded content, extending the syntax/grammar and processor lifecycle, and integrating with tools and publishing platforms.

Teams and individuals use AsciiDoc to write product documentation, technical specifications, architectural guides, scientific and analytical reports, academic courses and training materials, books, and other technical communication.
